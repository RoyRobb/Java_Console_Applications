# Java_Console_Applications

Different console applications, that I have/am developing to practice Java pl.

The list of projects done(✔) or in progress and their respective descriptions:

✔ **FizzBuzz Solution:** Console application that prints from 1 up to a chosen number. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

✔ **Palindrome Checker:** Console application that checks whether a chosen string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

✔ **Anagram Checker:** Console application that checks whether two chosen strings are anagrams (contain the same letters in a different order).

✔ **Linked List:** Console applicaion that implements a Linked List data structure.

✔ **Reverse a String:** Console application that reverses a chosen string.

✔ **Word Counter:** Console application that counts the number of words in a chosen string.

✔ **Fibonacci Sequence:** Console application that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a chosen number.

✔ **Quick Sort Algorithm:** Console application that sorts array using Quick Sort Algorithm.

✔ **Bubble Sort Algorithm:** Console application that sorts array using Bubble Sort Algorithm.

✔ **Insertion Sort Algorithm:** Console application that sorts array using Insertion Sort Algorithm.

✔ **Merge Sort Algorithm:** Console application that sorts array using Merge Sort Algorithm.

✔ **Prime Number Generator:** Console application that generates a list of prime numbers up to a chosen number.

✔ **Caesar Cipher:** Console application that encodes and decodes messages using the Caesar Cipher.

✔ **Binary Search:** Console application that performs a binary search on a sorted list of numbers.
