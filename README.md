# Java_Console_Applications

Different console applications, that I have/are developing to practice Java pl.

The list of projects done(✔) or in progress and their respective descriptions:

✔ **FizzBuzz Solution:** Console application that prints from 1 up to a chosen number. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

✔ **Palindrome Checker:** Console application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

✔ **Anagram Checker:** Console application that checks whether two given strings are anagrams (contain the same letters in a different order).

✔ **Linked List:** Console applicaion that implements a Linked List data structure.

✔ **Reverse a String:** Console application that reverses a given string.

✔ **Word Counter:** Console application that counts the number of words in a given string.

**Fibonacci Sequence:** Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

**Sorting Algorithms:** Write a program that implements different sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, or Merge Sort.

**Prime Number Generator:** Write a program that generates a list of prime numbers up to a given number.

**Caesar Cipher:** Write a program that encodes and decodes messages using the Caesar Cipher.

**Binary Search:** Write a program that performs a binary search on a sorted list of numbers.

Other ideas for projects:
Caesar Encryption/Decryption;
Library management application;
Plagiarism checker;
Minigames (Sudoku, TikTakToe, Battleships);
Minigame website (using REACT);
AI Backtracking (different algorithms);
Chess AI Bot.
